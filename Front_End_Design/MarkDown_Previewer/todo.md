### Markdown previewer feature checklist

#### V 1.0.0.0

- Plain html and react template with no functionality (mostly empty functions, comments and a little html)
  - A text entry field (the markdown text entry area)
  - A previewer panel
  - Link between text entry field and previewer ( sending text entry field content to previewer minus any parsing )

- Integrating markdown library
    - Adding real markdown parsing functionality (parsing text area content to markdown before sending it over to the previewer panel)

- Adding CSS and Bootstrap to give the app some shape.
